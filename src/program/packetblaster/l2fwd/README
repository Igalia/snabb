The `l2fwd` mode of packetblaster works similarly to the `replay` mode.

Packets are read from a .pcap file and get transmited continuously to a NIC.
In contrast to the `replay` mode, the `l2fwd` mode only reports aggregated average
statistics of total packets transmitted, packets received and packet difference.
Additionally, the `l2fwd` mode needs to run for 15 seconds to warm up.

This mode of packetblaster is aimed to be used in conjuntion with the `l2fwd`
program. This program forwards any packet received in a port to its emissor.

Examples:
  packetblaster l2fwd myfile.cap 01:00.0
