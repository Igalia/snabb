    -h, --help
                                Print usage information.

Optional arguments:

    IPV4_ADDRESS                IPv4 address to mirror. Default: 0.0.0.0.
    PID                         PID value of Snabb process.

Sets the value of 'v4v6_mirror' counter to IPV4_ADDRESS.  The 'v4v6_mirror'
counter is defined for all lwAFTR instances running in mirroring mode.
Matching packets will be mirrored to the tap interface set by the original
lwAFTR process.

PID value is used to retrieve the lwAFTR instance.  If PID is not set, the
most recent active lwAFTR instance for which 'v4v6_mirror' is defined is used.
