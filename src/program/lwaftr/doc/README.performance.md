# Tuning the performance of the lwaftr

## Adjust CPU frequency governor

Set the CPU frequency governor to _'performance'_:

```bash
for CPUFREQ in /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor; do
   [ -f $CPUFREQ ] || continue;
   echo -n performance > $CPUFREQ;
done
```

You might need to also go into your BIOS and verify that you have not
enabled aggressive power-saving modes that could downclock your
processors.  A CPU in a power-saving mode typically takes some time to
return to peak performance, and this latency can cause packet loss.

## Avoid fragmentation

Fragment reassembly in particular is a costly operation.  Make sure that
MTUs are set such that fragmentation is rare.

## NUMA

Each NIC is associated with a NUMA node.  For systems with multiple NUMA
nodes, usually if you have more than one socket, you will need to ensure
that the processes that access NICs do so from the right NUMA node.

For example if you are going to be working with NICs `0000:01:00.0`,
`0000:01:00.1`, `0000:02:00.0`, and `0000:02:00.1`, check:

```bash
$ for device in 0000:0{1,2}:00.{0,1}; do \
    echo $device; cat /sys/bus/pci/devices/$device/numa_node; \
  done
0000:01:00.0
0
0000:01:00.1
0
0000:02:00.0
0
0000:02:00.1
0
```

So all of these are on NUMA node 0.  Then check your CPUs:

```
$ numactl -H | grep cpus
node 0 cpus: 0 1 2 3 4 5
node 1 cpus: 6 7 8 9 10 11
```

So for these we should run our binaries under `taskset -c CPU` to bind
them to CPUs in the NUMA node 0.  You also need to run Snabb within
`numactl --membind` to make sure only to use memory that is close to
that NUMA node.

## Isolate CPUs

Force the Linux kernel to use a limited amount of CPUs to schedule its
processes, leaving all the other CPUs for running Snabb Switch.

To isolate CPUs, boot your Linux kernel with the `isolcpus` parameter.
Under NixOS, edit `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix` to add this parameter:

```
boot.kernelParams = [ "default_hugepagesz=2048K"  "hugepagesz=2048K"
                      "hugepages=10000" "isolcpus=1-5,7-11" ];
```

The line above prevents the kernel to schedule processes in CPUs ranging
from 1 to 5 and 7 to 11. That leaves CPUs 0 and 6 for the Linux kernel.
By default, the kernel will arrange deliver interrupts to the first CPU
on a socket, so this `isolcpus` setting should also isolate the
dataplane from interrupt handling as well.

After adding the `isolcpus` flag run `nixos-rebuild switch` and then reboot 
your workstation to enable the changes.

Note that if you are not running NixOS, you probably have `irqbalanced`
running, and so you might need to stop that to prevent interrupts being
delivered to your Snabb process.

## Ingress and egress filtering

Simply enabling ingress and/or egress filtering has a cost.  Enabling
all filtes adds 4 apps to the Snabb graph, and there is a cost for every
additional Snabb app.  In our tests, while a normal run can do 10 Gbps
over two interfaces in full duplex, enabling filters drops that to 8.2
Gbps before dropping packets.  However we have not found that the
performance depends much on the size of the filter, as the filter's
branches are well-biased.
