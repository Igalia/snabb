                             Hydra mode: emit CSV data in the format expected
                             by the Hydra reports. For instance:

                               benchmark,snabb,id,score,unit

                             rather than

Run the lwAFTR with input from IPV4-IN.PCAP and IPV6-IN.PCAP. The bench
command is used to get an idea of the raw speed of the lwaftr without
interaction with NICs, or check the impact of changes on a development
machine that may not have Intel 82599 NICs.  Exit when finished.  This
program is used in the lwAFTR test suite.

Packets are counted and recorded, and the corresponding incoming and outgoing
packet rates are written to standard output in CSV format, suitable for passing
to a graphing program.
