Validate and compile an address map.  An address map defines the set of
IPv4 addresses that are provisioned by an lwAFTR.  It also defines the
way in which those addresses are shared, by specifying the "psid_length"
and "shift" parameters for each address.  See RFC 7597 for more details
on the PSID scheme for how to share IPv4 addresses.

This command will atomically overwrite the output file.  If the output
file name ADDRESSES.MAP is not given as an argument, the output file
will be the name of the input file, minus a ".TXT" suffix if present,
plus a ".MAP" suffix.
